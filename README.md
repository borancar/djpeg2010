# Team D JPEG encoder

This is a HW implementation of a JPEG encoder in GEZEL. GEZEL is a
Hardware/Software Codesign Environment and you can find more information
at its (website)[http://rijndael.ece.vt.edu/gezel2/].

It was a team project for the course P&D Integrated Electronics at KU Leuven in
the spring semester of 2010.

The team in alphabetical order:
- Boran Car
- Yinwei Chen
- Carolien Goubert
- Shijie Hu
- Ben Maes
- Adrian Staniec

## Running

You need to have GEZEL installed and set in your path.

There are 2 scripts provided:
- go_sim - runs the simulation
- go_vhd - compiles GEZEL sources into VHDL sources suitable for synthesis
